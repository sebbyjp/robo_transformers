    "summary": "This code defines an abstract class called \"Agent\" for creating agents with internal state like history and past actions. The class has two required methods: a constructor \"__init__\" that can take arbitrary keyword arguments, and the \"act\" method which returns any type of output. This is marked as an Abstract Base Class (ABC) meaning it cannot be directly instantiated but must be subclassed by more specific classes.",
