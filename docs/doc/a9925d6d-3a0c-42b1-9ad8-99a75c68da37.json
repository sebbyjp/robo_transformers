    "summary": "This code defines two test functions, \"test_octo_agent\" and \"test_octo_agent_with_wrist\", which both create an OctoAgent object and test its functionality. The first function runs the demo with the agent, while the second function tests the agent's action generation by providing images and wrist data as inputs. The main part of the code executes the \"test_octo_agent\" function, checks that each action is not None and has a non-empty make() result.",
